      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <p>
        Thank You for playing my game! It really means a lot to know people notice my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you feel stuck, here are some instructions for the game.
        <b>Note: Unimplemented features will look like <span class="unimplemented">this</span></b>
      </p>
      <ol id="instructions" class="system">
        <li>Getting Started
          <ul>
            <li>You start off in the game with nothing. That is okay, you don't need anything yet.</li>
            <li>This game is text-based, meaning you type commands to get around and interact with people and things.</li>
            <li>To start off, you should know you have the following commands:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="talkTip">look- </span>describes the room you are in</li>
                <li class="unimplemented"><span class="talkTip">speak- </span>opens a dialogue with things to say, or you can say what you want</li>
                <li class="unimplemented"><span class="talkTip">search- </span>searches a room, container, or body for items. Takes any items automatically</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">go- </span>lists exits for each area, and allows you to choose exits by number</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">take- </span>takes a specified item from a room. Like search, but for single items and more general use</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">help- </span>prints out a help menu for quick reference</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It seems like a lot to deal with, but it will feel natural asyou play longer.</li>
            <li>Start off by typing 'look' to view your surroundings!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Getting Around
          <ul>
            <li>In order to go from room to room, you should use 'go' to list your exit options.</li>
            <li>Each exit option will have a number before it. To choose that exit, use 'go &lt;number&gt;' where &lt;number&gt; is the number for the exit.</li>
            <li>Locked Areas
              <ul>
                <li>Some areas have certain requirements in order for you to enter or exit them.</li>
                <li>Don't get stressed, just find another exit or find the thing to open it up.</li>
                <li>If an exit is unavailable, a message will show up in <span class="error">this color</span>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="unimplemented">Speech
          <ul>
            <li>Use 'speak' to talk to characters in the game.</li>
            <li>It works like 'go'
              <ul>
                <li>'speak' lists options with corresponding numbers</li>
                <li>'speak &lt;num&gt;' picks an option</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your options will change over time too, as people's conversations go on.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="unimplemented">Scavenging
          <ul>
            <li>Use 'search' to search an area, body, or container for items.</li>
            <li>Use 'take' to take an item sitting in a room. (not for items on bodies or in containers)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
