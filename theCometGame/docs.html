      <p>
        Thank You for playing my game! It really means a lot to know people notice my work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you feel stuck, here are some instructions for the game.
        <b>Note: Unimplemented features will look like <span class="unimplemented">this</span></b>
      </p>
      <ol id="instructions" class="system">
        <li>Getting Started
          <ul>
            <li>You start off in the game with nothing. That is okay, you don't need anything yet.</li>
            <li>This game is text-based, meaning you type commands to get around and interact with people and things.</li>
            <li>To start off, you should know you have the following commands:
              <ul>
                <li><span class="talkTip">look- </span>describes the room you are in</li>
                <li class="unimplemented"><span class="talkTip">speak- </span>opens a dialogue with things to say, or you can say what you want</li>
                <li ><span class="talkTip">search- </span>searches a room, container, or body for items. Takes any items from containers</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">go- </span>lists exits for each area, and allows you to choose exits by number</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">take- </span>takes a specified item from a room. Like search, but for single items and more general use</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">inventory- </span>shows items you have picked up during the game</li>
                <li><span class="talkTip">help- </span>prints out a help menu for quick reference</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It seems like a lot to deal with, but it will feel natural asyou play longer.</li>
            <li>Start off by typing 'look' to view your surroundings!</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Getting Around
          <ul>
            <li>In order to go from room to room, you should use 'go' to list your exit options.</li>
            <li>Each exit option will have a number before it. To choose that exit, use 'go &lt;number&gt;' where &lt;number&gt; is the number for the exit.</li>
            <li>Locked Areas
              <ul>
                <li>Some areas have certain requirements in order for you to enter or exit them.</li>
                <li>Don't get stressed, just find another exit or find the thing to open it up.</li>
                <li>If an exit is unavailable, a message will show up in <span class="error">this color</span>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="unimplemented">Speech
          <ul>
            <li>Use 'speak' to talk to characters in the game.</li>
            <li>It works like 'go'
              <ul>
                <li>'speak' lists options with corresponding numbers</li>
                <li>'speak &lt;num&gt;' picks an option</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your options will change over time too, as people's conversations go on.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Scavenging
          <ul>
            <li>This game features items and collectibles which you can find and pick up. Sometimes, you need them to get to other areas in the game.<li>
            <li>Items are either found exposed in rooms or stored in containers and on dead bodies.</li>
            <li>Search:
              <ul>
                <li>To search an area for items and containers/bodies, or to take items from containers and bodies use 'search'</li>
                <li>Alone, 'search' will find all items and containers in an area</li>
                <li>'search <i>desk</i>' would search a container called 'desk' in the current area</li>
                <li>'search <i>1</i>' would search the 1st container in an area as listed by 'search'</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Take:
              <ul>
                <li>To take items sitting in an area (i.e. not in a container) use "take"</li>
                <li>You can use the item name: 'take <i>iron bar</i>'</li>
                <li>Or the number: if 1) iron bar, then use 'take <i>1</i>'</li>
                <li>Either way works, and it is not case sensitive</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Inventory
          <ul>
            <li>To see cool stuff you've collected throughout the game, use 'inventory'</li>
            <li class='unimplemented'>'inventory <i>item name</i>' shows specific items in your inventory with the given <i>item name</i> rather than the whole thing.</li>
            <li class='unimplemented'>'inventory <i>item #</i>' shows a specific item by its <i>item number</i> position in your inventory.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
